hi, i'm alex ðŸ‘‹

i discovered my love for building at 16 â€” starting with a graphic design 
community that grew to 1.5k members during covid.

that spark for creation led me down an unconventional path:
â€¢ released music with 10k+ streams at 17
â€¢ led varsity squash team to #1 public hs ranking
â€¢ studied abroad in china at 19

now, i build products that matter:
â€¢ launched datematch.lol in 3 days (250+ users)
â€¢ exploring ai + hci research @ georgia tech
â€¢ leading ship it @ startup exchange
â€¢ building tools at the intersection of human-ai interaction

these experiences taught me one thing: whether it's building 
communities, creating music, or launching products, i'm driven by the 
desire to innovate and make an impact.

i value doing the right thing, being a good human, and fostering genuine 
relationships. through design, code, and creativity, i aim to build a 
better world â€” redefining the boundaries of what's possible.

currently building in atlanta.
